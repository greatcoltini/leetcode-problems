-- rotate by 90 -> right

Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],
				[2,4,8,10],
				[13,3,6,7],
				[15,14,12,16]]
				
Output: [[15,13,2,5],
		[14,3,4,1],
		[12,6,8,9],
		[16,7,10,11]]
		
		
understand the pattern:

matrix[i][0] becomes matrix[i][n]
matrix[i][1] becomes matrix [i + 1][n]

matrix[i][n] becomes matrix[n][n]

matrix[n][n] becomes matrix[n][0]

matrix[n][0] becomes matrix[0][0]



matrix[i][j] becomes
